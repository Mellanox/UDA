# Introduction #

I don't want to be too formal neither to be to legal.


# Details #

We are not religious on any scheme.  We welcome cooperation and contribution to open source.  I think we can be inspired by the following two external resources:

  * https://code.google.com/p/simal/wiki/CreatePatch
  * https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/CommitYourCode

Also, please notice that, based on the above resources, I created template for issues of type "patch".  This should help you open your patch issues as patches.

In addition I created label "Patch-Yes" that will help us to fast handle issues that contains patches.

Last thing, please make sure to check carefully whatever you submit before submitting.
